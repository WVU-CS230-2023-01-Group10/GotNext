GotNext is a web application created by our development team to improve the way games are played at parties. Users can create a party or join an existing party. Games can be created within the party for people to partner up and join. Hosts have the option to invite/remove players, decide the tournament style (queue, round robin, double elimination, etc...), and start/end the games. All users in the party can check the status of the game, the order of the queue, and view the other players in the game.
